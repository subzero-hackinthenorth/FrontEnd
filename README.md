# FrontEnd
This repo is in reference to the ShadowFighters.

This will be responsible for displaying the game on the computer screen. The backend is build on Javascript and python. The forntend is build on the Unity Platform.
Another major part of the frontend is the Android app. This app serve as the virtual reality window. The user will use her/his phone as a VR device and will get the First Person Perspective of the fighter.

The usage depends on the gameplay. There are two gameplays that we propose. The first one as one player. In this the only player will use the VR headset for FPP
